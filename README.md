# BigClips

Big-Clips is a game programmed in Java and JavaFX. The game consists of a story which the player the player can read throughout the games progression. The idea behind it is to create a larger game that controls several smaller games that the player must play before "unlocking" the next part of the story.

So far two smaller games have been implemented, Space Invaders programmed in JavaFX and Tre i rad, programmed in Java. The main game is built with JavaFX in which the user interface is made in Scene Builder (FXML documents) and is controlled through a controller class. The game is designed to be scalable so that the story can be built upon and several other smaller games can be added without too much hassle. 

IMPORTANT: If you are playing the game on a 144hz monitor, it is a good idea to turn it down to 60hz.
